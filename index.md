# INF633 - Advanced 3D Graphics (2021 - 2022)

Welcome to the lab sessions of INF633! The goal of this project is to create, starting from a flat empty terrain, one with interesting features, objects and dynamic, living creatures all interacting together. For this, multiple edition tools will be created and basic principles of animation and crowd simulation used to give life to the virtual world.
